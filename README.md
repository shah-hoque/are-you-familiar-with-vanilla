## Description
This application is deployed on the following link:
- https://shah-hoque.github.io/are-you-familiar-with-vanilla/

This JavaScript Quiz tests its users knowledge about vanilla JavaScript. The 10 questions are suitable for a beginner JavaScript coder.

The quiz is introduced with a space theme, where the user is considered a JavaScript hero if they manage to get to the end of the quiz before the timer gets to 0. 

The timer is set to 60 seconds and 10 seconds are deducted from the time if the user selects the wrong answer. If the user selects the correct answer, the user won't earn any extra benefit.

It is communicated to the user if they selected the right or wrong answer by a colour fill which appears after the selection is made. Green indicates a correct answer and red indicates a wrong answer.

Only users who complete the last question before the timer reaches 0 are considered JavaScript heros who are eligible to record their first name on the score board.
